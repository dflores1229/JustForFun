            <h2>Who is Gian Maria?</h2>
                <p> Most commonly known as Gian Maria, he was born in Southern Italy on April 12, 2002.
                    He is currently studying at Politecnico di Milano where he will receive his doctorate title in the late Summer.
                    Gian plans to continue his studies by pursuing a Masters in BioEngineering. He has not committed
                    to a Masters program as of April 17,2023 but sources say that among his choices, is the same college
                    where Albert Einstein studied. As part of his undergraduate studies, Gian particpated in an exchange 
                    program at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique in France. There he met his pajarita whom he loves to
                    send memes all day long.

                <h3>Reasons we <span style="color:red">love</span> Gian</h3>
                <p>We don't love Gian simply because he is always looking like the best served meal.
                We also love him because he is super talented, an aboslute academic weapon, super kind,
                super sweet, among many other things. He is always making everyone's day brighter, which
                is where one of his nicknames originates from. He is a very lovable human:)) </p>
