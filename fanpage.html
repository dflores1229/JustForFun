                <h3>Reasons we <span style="color:red">love</span> Gian</h3>
                <p>We don't love Gian simply because he is always looking like the best served meal.
                We also love him because he is super talented, an aboslute academic weapon, super kind,
                super sweet, among many other things. He is always making everyone's day brighter, which
                is where one of his nicknames originates from. He is a very lovable human:)) </p>
